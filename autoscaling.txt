Steps to configure and fix Autoscaling issue in AKS:

[set CriticalAddonsOnly as true - NoSchedule]: Taint to system nodepool
Once tainted no application pods will get deployed to system nodepool.


1. System nodepool: Standard_D8s_v3
2. User nodepool: Standard_D8s_v3

System nodepool: 3 nodes (default)
User nodepool: 2 nodes (default)

Both pools with autoscaling enabled (Min and Max as 1 and 3)

Kubernetes version: 1.25.11
Region: East US 2

Issue: 

Whenever the node is autoscaled, the metric-server pod is crashed on the scaled node. 
It is unable to scale down though the load is low as the metric-server pod is crashed.

Resolution:

1. Use Standard_D8s_v3
2. Update pod nanny from the default namespace.


apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: metrics-server-config
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
    addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: EnsureExists
data:
  NannyConfiguration: |-
    apiVersion: nannyconfig/v1alpha1
    kind: NannyConfiguration
    baseCPU: 100
    cpuPerNode: 1m
    baseMemory: 100Mi
    memoryPerNode: 8Mi


basecpu - increase and then restart the pod of metric-server.
basememory - increase and then restart the pod of metric-server if needed.
